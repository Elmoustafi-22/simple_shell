**simple_shell**
**A simple C shell project**
Description
This is a simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh). Additional functions are also included. This program was written entirely in C as a milestone project for Alx-Holberton School.

**Installation**
Clone this repository into your working directory. Files should be compiled with GCC and the following flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -Wno-format.

**Usage**
After compilation, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode.

**Interactive Mode**
In interactive mode, simply run the program and wait for the prompt to appear. From there, you can type commands freely, exiting with either the "exit" command or ctrl-D.

**Non-Interactive Mode**
In non-interactive mode, echo your desired command and pipe it into the program like this:

echo "ls" | ./shell In non-interactive mode, the program will exit after finishing your desired command(s).

This is the main page which contains all functions and descriptions of all the functions used in this Simple shell project.
